### Introduction
***
+ For this competition, the official have prepared the real-scenario multimodal data from the mobile Taobao, one of the largest e-commerce platforms. The dataset consists of Taobao search queries and product image features, which is organized into a query-based multimodal retrieval task.
Given a search query in natural language form, the participating teams are required to implement a model to rank a collection of candidate products based on their image features. Most of these queries are noun phrases searching for products with specific characteristics. The images of the candidate products are provided by the sellers displaying the product features. Candidate products most relevant to the query are regarded as the ground truth of the query, which are expected to be top-ranked by the participating models.
